This file contains my Logo design for a website called daddyoda.com

The process happened in several steps in Adobe Illustrator.
I have used the Golden ratio method to come up with the design

I had my client's discription and created pencil sketches based on their needs
The process went for several iterations and discussions.
Once the design sketch was decided I made a mock up with digital art.
Made the final design in Illustrator, and few more designes were also generated for 
various usecases.
